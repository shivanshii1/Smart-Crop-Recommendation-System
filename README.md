# Smart-Crop-Recommendation-System
Revolutionizing Indian agriculture, our Smart Crop Recommendation System uses ML to optimize crop selection. It offers personalized recommendations, aiding farmers in overcoming challenges like unpredictable weather and soil degradation. A total of 7 different models have been employed in this project including SVM, CatBoost, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boost, MLP Classifier, AdaBoost, and Random Forest with SVM leading at 98.40% accuracy.
The potential impact of this project on India's agriculture sector is significant. By enabling farmers to make informed decisions about crop selection based on data-driven recommendations, we can enhance yield quality and quantity, mitigate risks associated with climate variability, and improve overall farm profitability. Additionally, by promoting sustainable farming practices through optimized crop choices, our system can contribute to long-term environmental conservation efforts.
